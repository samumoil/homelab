In pihole dnsmasq.d folder there's custom.list file.
Entry 'address=/peikkoluola.com/10.10.10.17 will forward
all *.peikkoluola.com requests to 10.10.10.17 (swag).

In pihole custom.list file there are entries that
go to pihole container's /etc/hosts file. This way
we can add VM ip addresses to that file.
