sudo apt install syncthing
sudo systemctl enable syncthing@sam
sudo systemctl start syncthing@sam

After adding a shared folder on one node, you may have to change
it's path on the other node. Go to ~/.config/syncthing/config.xml
and find correct folder entry (check folder name from GUI).
Change folder to proper one. If needed, rename the funny named
folder to correct one and 'sudo systemctl restart syncthing@sam'.
